Here, I coded a bot using the Windsurf IDE. This bot searches for 50 specific names on a website, checks the date of birth to determine whether the search result is a person or a company, and if there is no birth date, it identifies it as a company and moves on to the next name. For individuals, it gathers their data using Playwright in a headless and 4-thread parallel processing system, and generates an Excel table with the results.
